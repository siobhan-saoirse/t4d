# Left 4 Fortress
A very work in progess conversion mod of Left 4 Dead 2 to Team Fortress 2.

To prevent confusion, This is not a Sourcemod. This is a special mod designed for Left 4 Dead 2. It overrides the talker system and adds custom voice lines for each character 
More stuff will be implemented in the future.

In order to install the Left 4 Fortress mod you NEED to extract the 'tf' folder into your 'Left 4 Dead 2' folder (not the one with lowercase and no spaces). After that, replace the gameinfo.txt in left4dead2 folder (not the one with uppercase letters and spaces) with the one I've given you.
