# Team 4 Dead
A very work in progress conversion mod of Left 4 Dead 2 to Team Fortress 2.

This is a special sourcemod designed for Left 4 Dead 2. It overrides the talker system and adds custom voice lines for each character, along with design changes and other TF2 transition stuff.
More stuff will be implemented in the future.

## How 2 Install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For the best experience, Sourcemod and Metamod is required. Extract the metamod_sourcemod_t4d.zip file into your "Left 4 Dead 2/left4dead2" folder, and add '-insecure' to your launch options.

> [!WARNING]
> Due to how L4D engine branch handles sourcemods, it doesn't correctly handle custom file mounting. Look into gameinfo_left4dead2.txt for more information.

1. Clone 't4d' to your sourcemods folder
2. Read the instructions in the gameinfo_left4dead2.txt file
3. Copy the gameinfo_left4dead2.txt file.
4. Go to your L4D2 directory, and go in the 'left4dead2' directory.
5. Delete the old gameinfo.txt, paste the gameinfo_left4dead2.txt file and rename it to 'gameinfo.txt'
5. Restart Steam.
6. You did it! You installed Team 4 Dead! If you're looking to play the mod, do not play Left 4 Dead 2. Instead, play Team 4 Dead. It should be in your library.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to play L4D2, look into the instructions i've given you through the gameinfo_left4dead2.txt file if you're looking to uninstall it.
